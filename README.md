# React Plabook Project

Simple personal project to practice separate react features like hooks, lyfecycles, and more using small components.

With this project my main objective is to keep testing and learning different approaches to create components and interact with data as well as created documentation on how to use the components and what is requiredto use them.

In the other hand, I'm using other technologies along with react like ExpressJs and Mongo to create a custom api.
